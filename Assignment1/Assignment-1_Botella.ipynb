    "In this first assignment you will explore a dataset, visualizing the dataset in various ways, and doing a preliminary analysis on the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment we are going to use the functionality of Pandas (the library, *not* the unbearably cute animal): https://pandas.pydata.org/ in order to manipulate datasets.\n",
    "In addition to Pandas, we are going to use Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/) and Numpy (http://www.numpy.org/) and you may also find Seaborn (https://seaborn.pydata.org/) useful for some data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unless you are explicitly asked to *implement* a particular functionality, you may assume that you may use an existing implementation from the libraries above (or some other library that you may find, as long as you *document* it).\n",

    "Each assignment should be done  individually. You may discuss general approaches with other students in the class, and ask questions to the TAs, but  you must only submit work that is yours . If you receive help by any external sources (other than the TA and the instructor), you must properly credit those sources, and if the help is significant, the appropriate grade reduction will be applied. If you fail to do so, the instructor and the TAs are obligated to take the appropriate actions outlined at http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/academicintegrity.html . Please read carefully the UCR academic integrity policies included in the link.\n"
